# Willow

## What is it?

***Willow*** is a decentralised crypto trading DEX on the AElf Blockchain. It provides the following features:

• **Swap** tokens. Includes single & multi-hop pool swap functionality. 

• **Pools**. Allows for:

1. ***Creation*** of liquidity pools with any token pair to allow others to be able to swap tokens.
2. ***Addition/Removal*** of liquidity from a pool.
3. ***Locking/Unlocking*** of liquidity to build trust among the community. Once the lockup period passes, one can unlock their liquidity. 

 
## How does it work?

Anyone with an AElf-tied wallet can use the app. Navigating around the interface should be familiar ground for you if you've used Uniswap before (our aim is to provide this level of ease-of-access). 

To use the app, ***request some tokens*** from our faucet. This will fund your wallet with some tokens to use in the app. In the future, we plan to support imports of native tokens from a user's wallet, but for now, these tokens should serve as a good testing point. 

Use the app! You may observe that you can easily swap between certain tokens. This is because I have already provided some liquidity for these pairs, but there are some token pairs that don't have a pool, so you can try to play around with deploying a pool and providing liquidity. 

## Challenges & Accomplishments

I have used Uniswap in the past and have truly come to enjoy it for its ease-of-use and abstraction over the complex world of DeFi to present users with a WYSWYG environment. As such, I wanted to build a similar tool for AElf users as -- going from the enormous popularity of Uniswap -- this would certainly strengthen (and increase) the community base around the AElf project. 

Going from knowing absolutely nothing about building DEXs and AMMs and writing contracts in C#, this entirely process was certainly overwhelming. However, the community over on Telegram were absolute gems, and I was able to navigate the process fairly easily after that.

## What's next?

After fixing a few known bugs in the UI and Smart Contracts, I hope to launch Willow on AElf Mainnet, and launch a campaign that gets people excited about the idea of a Uniswap-like tool on AElf. I also hope to gain the support of the AElf Grant programs to help scale this project further. I believe this would be of great interest to many people, and would contribute in bringing in many more people to the wonderful AElf Blockchain. 

Pending TODOs:

- Offer staking functionality 
- Provide staking rewards to users that stake in a pool
- Borrowing/Lending, with collateralisation
